## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course has been an almost weekly rollercoaster of dread and relief. Every Monday and Tuesday feeling as if there is no way that I will ever learn this material that Mich is teaching us. But come Thursday/Friday here I am thinking I know everything because like every week it just starts to click. As far as my concerns, I don't have any. I plan to work the majority of the weekend to lighten my load during the weekdays. I have enjoyed the difficulty of this course far more than I thought I would.
