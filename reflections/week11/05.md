# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I almost finished my backend before leaving on Friday.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

That we could have just used Auth settled instead on some weird timing thing for our sockets in our capstone.
- What are you struggling with?

A couple of my postman tests.
- What would you count as a victory?

getting over half of my final done over the weekend.
