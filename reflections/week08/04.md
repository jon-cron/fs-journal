## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing, component testing, and end-to-end (E2E) testing. 
Unit testing - allows to test small isolated bits of code.
Component testing - must be mounted to the DOM and works with Vue-dev tools.
E2E - a more holistic test and the best benchmark of the 3 tests.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Unit testing could prove to be the most useful because I test small more often than I test large.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Component testing seemed to be the middle child with the least amount of use.
