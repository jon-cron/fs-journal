# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

We got the backend completed by Thursday!
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

The importance of prioritizing aspects of the backend to allow the frontend to begin work.
- What are you struggling with?

The concept of tests makes sense but I would like to start putting them into practice to grasp what is actually happening.
- What would you count as a victory?

We got extremely close to our MVP within the week
