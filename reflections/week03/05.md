# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?

This week was quite difficult but by the end of thursday and throughout friday, I felt very comfortable with the new material.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I was surprised how difficult it was to grasp the understanding of the new model.

- What are you struggling with?

I would say that I am still struggling with conforming to change from week to week.

- What would you count as a victory?

I was able to complete my checkpoint and feel confident that I completed all of the requirements.
