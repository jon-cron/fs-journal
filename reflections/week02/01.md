## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
   Scope is where variables are available for use. This is why we are discouraged from using VAR. VAR is globally acknowledged and let is also globally scoped but can also be recognized locally.
2. What is Hoisting ?
   Hoisting the order in which data is presented.
   let num1 = 0
   num1 += 1
   console.log(num1) = 1

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
   use const when you wish for data to never be changed.
   use let for all other occasions.
   don't use var
