# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  Around the end of wednesday and throughout Thursday, javascript concepts began to make much more sense.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  After a few days, I was surprised how easy javascript bacame.
- What are you struggling with?
  I am still struggling with drawing to the page and writing cleaner / shorter code. I feel that my code is drawn out and can be shorter and more exact.
- What would you count as a victory?
  Being able to complete my friday checkpoint with little to no referencing.
