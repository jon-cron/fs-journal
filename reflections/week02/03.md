## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
   By using a console.log(). This can be a quick check to see if your functions and code are working how they should be.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
   The elements tab. A developer can use this tab to write in temporary code and see how that code interacts with the page rather than writing the code and refreshing the page. This way the developer knows the exact code to write for the desired result.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
   By using javascript debugging tools. These tools allow the developer to see the exact point where the error is starting.
