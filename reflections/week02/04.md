## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

I found that taking a couple extra minutes and wireframing my project saves me time and headache later in the project.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Nine times out of ten I would reference projects from earlier in the week. If that didn't work, I would begin to google for solutions.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

The article discussed choosing the first solution you find and running with it. Multiple times this week, I would choose the first solution that would solve my problem but would not consider the compounding problems that this solution would cause me later down the road.

Game logic is much more difficult that when you have to break down logic in multiple ways. I had a compounding probability of either landing a hit or miss. I combine a decreasing stamina bar and a varying probability rate by using random numbers. It was quite fun figuring out the solution that made it work.
