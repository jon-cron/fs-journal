## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is the encoding  schema used for representing binary in text form.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Increases image size which will increase bandwidth and download time.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Applications are bigger and work in different ways than in the past; we would rather have our bandwidth and CPU overhead working on our requests or processing a transaction than wasting time on a base64 image.
