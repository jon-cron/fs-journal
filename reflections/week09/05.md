# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

We finished the project, got all of our ideals done, and most of our features.

How incredibly easy it was to implement sockets was.
- What are you struggling with?

Still a little unsure of the in's and out's of the backend.
- What would you count as a victory?
