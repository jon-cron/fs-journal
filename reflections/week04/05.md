# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?

I got much more proficient at connecting and setting up my model.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

API's are quite resourceful and useful.

- What are you struggling with?

I am still somewhat struggling with debugging and immediately freaking out when my application crashes.

- What would you count as a victory?

I was able to complete my wednesday project with little help from the TA's.
