# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

My checkpoint went well this week.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

The frontend might be more difficult than the backend. Although that may change from application to application.
- What are you struggling with?

Figuring out how to fix my page load and auth timing.
- What would you count as a victory?

Figuring out how to get Authorized before calling to my db for a request that requires auth, all the while trying to reduce page load time.
