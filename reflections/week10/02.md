## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is a generic type and is similar to a JS array.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.Add, List[index], List.Clear, List.Findall, List.FindIndex, List.Insert, and List.Remove. Any method that allows me to manipulate/change the data of the list.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

List[index]. I can see myself combining this with a var using List.FindIndex for a reusable function.
