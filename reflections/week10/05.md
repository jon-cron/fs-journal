# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

How different and simple it is to use SQL.
- What are you struggling with?

I am still slightly struggling with SQL syntax.
- What would you count as a victory?

Finishing the minimum requirements for my recipe backend before the end of the week.
