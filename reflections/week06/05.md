# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

the partner project.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I was surprised how difficult the checkpoint was.
- What are you struggling with?

understanding the difference between account and profile.
- What would you count as a victory?

this being more of my most impressive looking checkpoint projects yet.
