## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Pseudo-classes allow further design once something has happened. Point only happening once the cursor hovers over the selected object.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity determines what code ultimately makes the changes. A class is more specific than selecting body or H2.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Don't use important.
