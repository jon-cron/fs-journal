# Intro to JavaScript

**1.** Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
let, const, and not var
```

**2.** What is the definition of a function?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
A subprogram designed to perform a particular task
```

**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
Single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle.
```

**4.** Given this array:

```js
let fruit = ["apple", "banana", "pineapple", "orange", "strawberry"];
```

What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
2. Because it is the third from the front and the first object is 0
```

**5.** With these two objects:

```js
let you = { name: "You", hair: true, friends: [] };
let them = { name: "Them", hair: false, friends: [] };
```

how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
you.friends.push(them)
```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
let num1 = 5
if (num1 < 10){
  return true
}
```

**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "**\_\_**" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?

```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
i++
```

**8.** What does the `DOM` acronym stand for? Which file is first accessed to render the `DOM`?

```

**10.** When it comes to functions or methods, what is the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
Parameters define the function. Arguments use the values passed to them through the parameters.
```

**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
Reference types (dynamic) are larger or have the ability to be larger than primitive. An object can have several types: name(string), age(number), while a primitive can only be a single type.
```
